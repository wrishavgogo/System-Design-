Contains notes and we make a note what we learnt each day 



Research Papers: 

In System Design we will try to read research papars as well and Capture what understanding we got . Make notes . And we will need to do it diligently . 
Process we should use to study research papers . 

Websites :

1. https://scholar.google.com/ 
2. Keep an eye out on LinkedIn , many people like Arpit Bhiyani post lots of stuff regarding research papers which they studied 
3. https://arpitbhayani.me/papershelf -> Papers which Arpit Bhiyani recommends to read 


Instead of finding the best paper , just pick a paper and go for it . 

* Any Research Paper you are reading , give it 3 iterations 


* 1st Iteration try to read through the research paper very quickly without trying to understand a lot of stuff . Without trying to understand it , just go through it . This helps in forming the big dots in the brain . 

Why will we do it this way ? 

Formation of this big dots in the brain , will help us get the theme of the paper . And the things I could expect from it . 
When we are skimming highlight things which seem interesting and new , which you want to read about it . 


* 2nd Iteration , read the paper thoroughly. Now we try to make sense of it . 
The Broad dots are not connecting and the dots are starting to densely connect . 


*3rd Iteration : This time you prepare notes . Based on your understanding . Prepare it in such a way as if you are teaching it to someone . 
This challenges your understanding if you understood the thing properly or not .
